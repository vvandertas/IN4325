# IN4325 - Bing Search Api with Hints extension
This project is created as part of the Information Retrieval course (IN4325) at TUDelft. The aim of the project is to create an experimental setup to determine the effects of providing users with hints when searching to find the answer to complex questions.
This allows us to reproduce the study as described in the following [paper](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2609523):

## Running the project
First make sure that the java compiler for this project runs command line parameter '-parameters'. This allows jdbi to infer query bindings based on method parameters without requiring '@Bind' annotations.

To run the project you can simple run the following command:  
```
mvn jooby:run -Dbing.apiKey=[YOUR KEY]
```

Make sure to replace YOUR KEY with your Bing Search API license key.
